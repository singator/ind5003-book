What is a country without its people. It is sad to see such dillema happening
but ultimately, it depends on what are the aims of the Singapore government.
Both decisions have benefits and repercusions. If Singapore values rules and
stability of the country more than the sports achievements of the country, then
setting strict NS deferment rules will serve well for Singapore's goals.  In
that case, Benjamin Davis can very well renouce his citizenship from Singapore
to pursue his career and not worry about his National Services liabilities. For
a country build upon rules and stability, Singapore have to forgo talented
individuals that rock its system; it is a necessary evil. However, I still hope
that MINDEF and the Davis family can reach a mutual understanding.
