From my perspective, I think Ben Davis should be allowed to defer his National
Service. Not allowing a young talent like Ben Davis to defer his NS is a loss
to Singapore. For one thing, athletes only have a short golden period in their
career. The offer from English club is a precious opportunity in every
footballer's career. If Ben Davis is to serve the National Service, he will
lose his contract with that English club and cannot get professional training
for two years, which will definitely result in his setback in skills. After
finishing his National Service, he may never have the chance to play in top
clubs, and his whole career as a footballer may be ruined. For another, though
National Service is compulsory for Singaporeans, exception should still be
allowed. What the government mainly considers may be the equality in citizen
duty, but there are many different ways for citizens to serve their country.
There are thousands of healthy young males who can serve the national service,
but not all of them can be a top footballer. Special talents should be treated
differently, and laws should not be carried out rigidly. In a word, one less
soldier doesn't make the national defense weaker, but one less top football
player does weaken the national football level. Granting a deferral to young
genius is not a corruption in the legal system, but a respect for talents,
which may also contribute to the country in another unique way.
