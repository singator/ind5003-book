I am opposed to this proposal. Because if government of Singapore approved
this, it would likely to be unequal for others who are males and have to serve
the army. As far as I am concerned, this may causes social discontent towards
Ben Davis, and as a consequence, his sports career may be permanently stained
to certain degree. So, there should be a tradeoff for Ben to consider. Whether
the benefits of postponing this service overshadow the harm it imposed on his
long-term career? Maybe he can realize fast promotion in recent years since he
captures the opportunity; it is absolutely possible that it does not last long.
Moreover, as a citizen in Singapore, he ought to think more about his country,
instead of focusing too much on his own interests and so on, not to mention
that this army service is part of the law. 
On the other hand, should government approve such proposal? If it does so, it
may lose its credits towards the vast majority of the people, considering that
Ben's excuse is nothing about health but personal interests. Admittedly, one
should pay attention to her own benefits under most circumstances, especially
in areas like business, etc. Still, when confronted with law or social
regulations that apply to most of other people, Ben should think it again.
However, when we think more about it, we may ask whether it is necessary that
the government of Singapore enforce this army service? More topics can be
discussed under this question.
