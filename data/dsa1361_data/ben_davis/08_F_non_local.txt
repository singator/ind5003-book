Actually I disagree with his request.
Firstly, given that serving in the army is the obligation of each citizen in
Singapore, there should be no exception. In my opinion, only appropriate
reasons like physical disabilities could be accepted.
Secondly, joining a football team mainly results from his personal interest, in
that what he intends to join is an English team instead of a local one.
Therefore, he could not make contributions to Singapore during his absent
period if he should join the football team.
Thirdly, the more time he wishes to defer, the worse his physical conditions
will be when he serves in the Singapore army. So there is some difference
between his normal state and the later state.
Finally, serving in the army can be deemed as an exercise for a youth like him.
I do think he needs to experience some "torments" in the army so that he can
become a better man in the future. Considering my own experience, I think it is
always the most tough time that gives me opportunities and time to contemplate
about my future. Although the time staying in the army can be torturous, I
believe he can be more mature and responsible in the future.
However, I think if he offers some compensations to Singapore after he retires
from the football team, his request can be acceptable. The compensation can be
contributing half amount of his total revenue in his team to Singapore or some
other forms.
