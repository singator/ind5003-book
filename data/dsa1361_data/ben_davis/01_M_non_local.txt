I am familiar with Singapore's NS requirements and that it is considered a duty
as a Singaporean.  But also I am familiar with Singapore's National Football
team and feel that this too great an opportunity for a local player to miss out
on.  By allowing deferment Singapore will have the opportunity to be
represented in one of the top 3 leagues in the world.  As there have been
exceptional cases for past athletes and academics, I think that Ben Davis' case
also applies to these circumstances and therefore should be allowed deferement.
Ben Davis will be allowed to achieve his dream and also inspire local children
and bring pride to Singaporeans and footballing respect from the international
community.  As long as he still aims to complete his National Service, there
should be no quarrel as to whether he can defer.  The Government should support
their own citizen and not be so controlling of their youth.  If he undertakes
Natinal Sevice now, he will fall behind competitvely with his team mates and
other athletes and so may not get another chance to compete at such a level.
Although it is not definite that he can play in England's premier league, that
is no excuse to not let him.  To others participating in National Service
forcefully, they might deem it unfair but they should stop whining.  To be a
top athlete is not easy and the work he is doing could be considered harder
depending on assigned platoon.
