I feel that he should be granted deferment from NS. The government reinforced
that one of the requirements to be granted one is that you will have to be a
potential award winner for the nation. Although Ben Davis is not yet at that
level, he is already way above the rest of the males in Singapore in terms of
this. Having a contract with a professional football team is an achievement and
definitely a step to being a potential award winner. As the saying goes, "You
will never succeed if you never try." Dear government, you encourage
Singaporeans to dare to dream, to achieve the impossible. But what you are
doing now is forbidding people from dreaming, even when the possible is already
presented right in front of us lol. I mean, hello? It's EPL. Do you even know
what it is? World Soccer stars were born there. They shine through playing in
the league. You want Singapore to shine right? Let him go UK to play la.
Watching him shoot the GPMG in the night with the tracer round is not the way
to watch him shine. This one is the night sky shine. And you pollute the sky
also, all the carbon and smoke. I thought got the G20 summit? Work towards it
and let him defer, save the Earth and earn a potential medal for Singapore man.
