While I share the sentiment with many Singaporeans that Ben Davis should be
granted deferment, I feel that MINDEF is in a tough spot. If there's no
deferment for Ben Davis, MINDEF will not upset those with rejected deferments
but will inadvertently upset Ben Davis by ending his professional football
dream career. However, if they allow the deferment to pass for Ben Davis,
MINDEF will upset those people who got rejected by deferment. This shows that
in both scenarios, someone will get upset eventually and there's no win-win
situation. However, I feel that Ben Davis should be granted deferment. Some
minister had his son defer NS just to go overseas to study. Why is his son
granted special treatment? They rejected Ben Davis on the premise that his
reason for deferment is for his career advancement and is not different from
the other rejected deferment cases. Isn't letting the minister's son go
overseas to study a form of career advancement too? Ben Davis just wants to
defer. He is not thinking of avoiding National Service completely. This is an
opportunity of a lifetime. Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said that
Singapore will be put on the World Cup stage one day. It is laughable and
lamentable that it will never happen. Many Singaporeans support Ben Davis, and
wishes that his deferment is approved by MINDEF. Ben Davis might be a special
case, different from other different deferment applicants due to the fact that
he could perhaps bring Singapore's soccer scene to a whole new level.
