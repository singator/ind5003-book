Ben Davis should not be allowed to defer National Service as it constitutes the
foundation of Singapore's defence. Although the size of the Singapore Armed
Forces is not in danger of shrinking and more females are getting inspired to
serve the country, earning a living as a sportsman is, at its highest levels, a
risk at every junction. Joseph Schooling, being the first Singaporean to win a
gold medal at the Olympic Games, could be considered an exception, but the
footballer Ben Davis is requires long periods of training and trying out at
different clubs before any measure of success can be expected, time that would
be better served learning how to defend against attacks, both real and online.

In addition, football has been brought into disrepute recently with FIFA,
Russia and the World Cup being clouded in a shadow of human rights abuses,
wasted money and treatment of fans as compared to players. Although some level
of corruption has been removed from the global game, including the infamous
hooligan incidents of English and other domains, such removal has created
nothing but a sterilised environment not maellable into an inclusive experience
for everyone involved, as compared to more introverted and mindful activities
like drawing and writing. Returning to National Service, there are a good
number of benefits given to actively serving personnel as reward for their
work, but very little compensation of the same kind for athletes. In short, Ben
Davis should not sacrifice the good life he already has locally for a wandering
career across the whole untrusted Earth.
