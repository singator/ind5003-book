I feel that Ben Davis should be allowed to defer from his national service
because he has gotten a golden opportunity to sign a professional contract with
one of the European football league clubs. Apart from pursuing his football
passion, this contract will allow him to contribute to the Singapore sports
sector in the long run and it will definitely be a feat for our country.
Although national service is integral for every Singaporean man, the government
should reconsider about giving his deferment as it did for other national
players like Joseph Schooling and Quah Zheng Wen.  Those players were able to
focus more on their sports career because of their deferment and now they have
brought Singapore pride with their international achievements. As such, I feel
that it will be unfair if Ben is not given equal chances as them. The
government should be more flexible in allowing the budding talents to pursue
their dreams. In fact, when France won the recent FIFA, one of the Singapore
ministers had commented that France's football system encourages and supports
in developing every young person's strengths. This is exactly why France was
able to clinch the World Cup and Singapore still holds as the 169th place in
the FIFA world rankings. All in all I feel that if deferment is not given,
Singapore will lose a potential international football player who can possibly
bring our country to greater heights.
