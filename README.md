## Setup instructions

In order to render the pdf and html versions on your own, you will need to:

1. Create a top-level folder called `env` and create a virtual environment there.
2. Use the `requirements.txt` file to install the correct packages and versions.
3. Install quarto.

You can then use Rstudio to render the pdf and/or html versions. It should pick up the 
virtual environment automatically, without needing reticulate.
